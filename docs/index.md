# Capture The Flag 101 ðŸš©

Welcome to **CTF101**, a site documenting the basics of playing Capture the Flags. This guide was written and maintained by the [OSIRIS Lab](https://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/) at New York University in collaboration with [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/).

In this handbook you'll learn the basicsâ„¢ behind the methodologies and techniques needed to succeed in Capture the Flag competitions.

## OSIRIS Lab

The **Offensive Security Incident Response Internet Security Lab** is a student-run, student-organized security lab at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering. Founded in 2003, the lab has deep roots in the NYC security scene running CSAW every year. We build and run everything ourselves: university classes, research infrastructure, and even this page. 

To learn more about the lab, visit our [website](https://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu).
